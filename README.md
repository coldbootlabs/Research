# Cold Boot Labs

Cold Boot Labs is a personal research effort focused on embedded systems,
firmware architecture, and security at the boundary between hardware and software.

Areas of interest include:
- Secure boot and root-of-trust design
- Firmware update mechanisms and rollback protection
- RTOS isolation and failure modes
- Physical and semi-physical attacker models

This repository hosts research notes, experiments, and supporting material.
